        <p><h4> Historians believe that the human settlements existed in these parts for at least ten centuries before Christ. Much evidence of New Stone Age civilisation can be seen in the hills throughout the present day Wayanad district. The Edakkal Caves has 6000-year-old rock engravings from the Neolithic age. The recorded history of this district is available only from the 18th century. In ancient times, this land was ruled by the Rajas of the Veda tribe.[11]

            <h4><p> Dynasty
            In the earliest part of the recorded history of Wayanad District, it was ruled by the Chera dynasty, who ruled entire Kerala and Kanyakumari District with parts of western Tamil Nadu State from before the birth of Christ though the first few centuries of the Common Era. Kasaragod-Kannur-Wayanad Districts in the northern part of present-day Kerala were ruled by the Nannans (Mushika dynasty who later came to be known as the Kolathiris) and they were relatives and regents of the Cheras. (Similarly, Kanyakumari-Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam Districts were ruled by the Ay/Venad/Thiruvithamkur Dynasty, who were also relatives and regents of the Cheras.)
